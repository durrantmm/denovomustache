# How it works
The *mustache* workflow is described by the schematic below:
![alt text](img/workflow.png)

All that is required is a reference genome and short-read (less than 300 bp) sequencing data of the organism under study.

The *mustache* software suite provides tools to perform most of the analyses depicted above, including:

* Identifying candidate insertion sites and generates consensus sequence of insertion flanks (see `findflanks` and 
command)
* Pairs candidate insertion flanks with each other (see `pairflanks` command)
* Infers sequence identity from a sequency assembly (see `inferseq-assembly` command)
* Infers sequence identity from a reference genome (see `inferseq-reference` command)
* Infers sequence identity from a database of known inserted elements (see `inferseq-database` command)
* Infers sequence identity by attempting to merge flanks in the event that they are long enough to overlap and span the 
entire insertion (see `inferseq-overlap` command)
* EXPERIMENTAL: Extends candidate insertion flanks using a local alignment approach.

It does NOT perform the following steps:
* Alignment of isolate to sample (We recommend [BWA MEM](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) for this step.)
* Assembly of short-read sequencing reads (We recommend [SPAdes](http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/) for this step.)
* Clustering of identified sequences by similarity (We recommend [CD-HIT-EST](http://weizhongli-lab.org/cd-hit/)).


## Limitations
Identifying large structural variants from short-read sequencing data is always an inferential task. 
The insertions identified in this pipeline are inferred, but we try to increase our sensitivity by combining several 
different inference approaches. However, there are limitations that should be taken into account with this analysis, 
such as:

1. We only identify those insertions that occur within the reference genome used.
2. More complicated insertions, such as insertions within insertions, are likely to be missed, especially if they 
include repetitive elements and cannot be assembled within the expected sequence context.
